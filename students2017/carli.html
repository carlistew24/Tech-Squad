      Hey there! I'm a Senior here @ Mayfield, who was pretty much forced into taking this class. So here I am trying to learn all about computers
      and the struggle is REAL. People can see me volunteering since I am the Prez of Interact Club, I am also VP of Spanish CLub because I
      have a love hate relationship with the Spanish language.
